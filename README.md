List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used for designing, developing, testing, and deploying software efficiently. It consists of several phases, each serving a specific purpose.

1. Planning
This phase involves defining the project scope, objectives, and feasibility.
Stakeholders analyze requirements, estimate costs, and allocate resources.
A feasibility study is conducted to assess risks and determine whether the project is viable.
2. Requirements Analysis
Software requirements are gathered from users, business analysts, and stakeholders.
Functional and non-functional requirements are documented in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS).
This phase ensures that the software meets business and user needs.
3. Design
The system architecture, data models, and user interfaces are planned.
High-level design (HLD) defines system structure, while low-level design (LLD) details components.
Technologies, frameworks, and security measures are chosen.
4. Implementation (Coding)
Developers write code based on design specifications.
Programming languages, tools, and frameworks are used to build software components.
Version control systems and coding standards are followed to maintain quality.
5. Testing
The software is tested for bugs, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities.
Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) are performed.
Test cases are executed to ensure the software functions as expected.
6. Deployment
The software is released to users in a production environment.
Deployment can be done in stages (e.g., beta testing, phased rollout) to minimize risks.
Cloud, on-premises, or hybrid deployment strategies are chosen based on business needs.
7. Maintenance and Support
Bug fixes, updates, and performance improvements are made after deployment.
New features or enhancements are added based on user feedback.
Regular monitoring ensures the software remains secure and operational.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall and Agile are two distinct software development methodologies, each with its own advantages and ideal use cases.

Feature	Waterfall Methodology	Agile Methodology
